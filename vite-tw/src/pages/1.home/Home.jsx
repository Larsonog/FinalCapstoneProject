            Welcome to Encylopedia Conway a webpage for anything and everything going on in Conway, Arkansas.
            This project is for my Senior Seminar class at Hendrix College. I am currently a senior there
            graduating in May 2024. This website has always been a passion project for me. As a lifetime Conway
            resident myself, I have always wanted to know what's going on and finding that information has always
            been difficult. This project is both for new and long time residents for Conway.
            Enjoy!
